For Real-Time example:-
we can take students details Program.

Requirements:-

Have to build a program with the records of students details.
Concept for this program should be :- Method Overloading.

How to program this:-

we will create one Method by passing the details of student as a parameter.
then have to call the instance of this method in our main method.

Why using Method Overloading for this program:-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
suppose we have created one metod for this program where we are getting the details:- student name, roll, age, class etc.
but later on if we got other requirement or features to be added in this same program then we can use following approaches but we have to choose the
most effective one:-
1.)  we can add others requirement in the same method- but if we are not sure that this new requirement will be parmanent or not, if not then again 
we have to edit this code in future.

2.) we can add other method with the new requirement- but for student details only if we have two or more methods than it will be challenging to
recall all the methods if in future we will have more functionality like we can have students acedemic details, interests, achievements etc.

3.) we can add other methode but the name of both methods will be same only parameters will be different- by approaching this we can add or remove
functionality to this program easily and if new people will join later they can easily identify which method is for students acedemic, interest, achievements etc details.
